# Bridge between ROS Noetic and ROS 2 Jazzy with MRS Custom Message Support

This fork of `ros2/ros1_bridge` integrates support for **MRS-specific custom messages and services**, and includes essential patches to ensure full compatibility between ROS 1 (Noetic) and ROS 2 (Jazzy).

## Modifications from Original `ros2/ros1_bridge`

This fork currently includes the following modification:

### Added Conversion for `std_msgs/Time` â†” `builtin_interfaces/msg/Time`

The original bridge did not provide specializations for bridging time messages, resulting in linker errors like:

```
undefined reference to convert_1_to_2<Time>
```

To fix this, the following template specializations were added in  
`src/ros1_bridge/convert_builtin_interfaces.cpp` and  
`include/ros1_bridge/convert_builtin_interfaces.hpp`:

```cpp
template<>
void convert_1_to_2(
  const std_msgs::Time & ros1_msg, 
  builtin_interfaces::msg::Time & ros2_msg);

template<>
void convert_2_to_1(
  const builtin_interfaces::msg::Time & ros2_msg, 
  std_msgs::Time & ros1_msg);
```

These functions enable proper bidirectional conversion of ROS 1 and ROS 2 time messages, resolving linker issues and allowing seamless communication.

## How to build and run the bridge (to be added)

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Have a ubuntu 20 env with ros noetic.

Build ros jazzy from source (official turorial). ADD LINK HERE

### Step 2: Build the ros noetic workspace

```sh
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
# git clone -b bridge_noetic ... WILL ADD THE BRANCH FIRST
cd ..
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
catkin_make_isolated --install
```

### Step 3: Build the ros2 humble workspace

```sh
mkdir -p ~/colcon_ws/src
cd ~/colcon_ws/src
# git clone -b bridge_noetic ... WILL ADD BRANCH FIRST
cd ..
source ~/ros2_humble/instal/setup.bash
colcon build
```

### Step 4: Build ros1_bridge

The build took about 16 minutes on my laptop.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/bridge_ws/src
cd bridge_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:fly4future/ros1_bridge.git
cd ..
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_humble/instal/setup.bash
source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select ros1_bridge --cmake-force-configure
```

### Step 5: Run the bridge
